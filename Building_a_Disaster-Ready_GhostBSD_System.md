# Building a Disaster-Ready GhostBSD System: Practicality Meets Resilience

Disaster rarely announces itself. It can come as a storm that topples power lines, a flood that drowns cities, or a cyber-attack that cripples infrastructure. In these moments, technology becomes both a lifeline and a shield. A computer system, carefully designed for disaster preparedness, can enable you to stay informed, connected, and operational, even when the world around you is in chaos. This GhostBSD-powered system is not a luxury; it is a necessity, built with precision and purpose.

## Core Components: Where Power Meets Efficiency

At the heart of this system is the AMD Ryzen 5 5600G processor, chosen for its balance of power and efficiency. Its six cores handle multitasking with ease, and its integrated Radeon graphics eliminate the need for a discrete GPU. This decision is deliberate: fewer components mean less power draw, reduced heat, and fewer points of failure. At $150, the Ryzen 5 5600G offers the reliability and versatility required for disaster scenarios.

The processor resides on an ASRock B450M Pro4 motherboard, a workhorse that values functionality over flash. Priced at $100, it provides everything needed: support for the CPU, DDR4 RAM, and multiple storage devices, along with essential ports for peripherals. This board was chosen for its wide compatibility, ease of repair, and affordability.

Memory is modest but expandable. The system includes 16GB of DDR4 RAM, costing $50. This is sufficient for running GhostBSD smoothly while leaving headroom for tasks such as ZFS snapshots, communication applications, and light virtualization. The choice of DDR4 ensures widespread availability for replacements or upgrades in the future.

Storage is a critical decision. The system relies on a 1TB Crucial MX500 SSD, priced at $70, for its operating system and vital files. SSDs are inherently more durable and energy-efficient than hard drives, ensuring reliability during extended use. For backups, a 2TB Seagate portable USB HDD, costing $60, offers flexibility. Its portability allows you to secure or transport critical data easily, an essential feature in situations requiring evacuation.

## Power: Independence Through Sustainability

When the grid fails, power becomes the most critical resource. This system answers that challenge with a 500W portable solar panel array, such as the Jackery SolarSaga, at an approximate cost of $500. This array is lightweight, efficient, and capable of generating sufficient energy to sustain the computer, a monitor, and networking equipment.

The energy harvested is stored in a 1kWh lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery station, such as the EcoFlow River 2 Max, priced at $700. LiFePO4 batteries are chosen for their long lifespan, fast recharge times, and safety features, making them ideal for disaster scenarios. Unlike lead-acid batteries, they can be cycled deeply without significant degradation.

For extended outages or cloudy days, a Honda EU2200i generator offers a reliable backup. At $1,000, this generator balances portability with fuel efficiency, consuming less than a gallon of gas for over eight hours of runtime. Combined with the solar-battery setup, it ensures continuous power regardless of weather conditions or access to fuel.

## Communication: Staying Connected When It Matters Most

In a disaster, information and communication are lifelines. This system includes the Starlink satellite internet kit, priced at $599 with a $110 monthly subscription. Starlink’s satellite coverage provides internet access in even the most remote locations, ensuring that updates, weather alerts, and emergency communications remain uninterrupted. Its portability allows the system to remain functional even during evacuation or relocation.

For local communication, the Icom IC-7300 HAM radio is included at a cost of $1,200. In a scenario where satellite and terrestrial networks are compromised, HAM radio provides a reliable means of communication, allowing contact with local emergency networks or other operators.

## Peripherals: Reliable and Practical Choices

The system includes a 24-inch Dell SE2422HX monitor, costing $150. Its Full HD resolution provides clear visuals without excessive power consumption, making it ideal for long-term use on limited energy reserves. Input devices are kept simple with a wired Logitech K120 keyboard and M100 mouse, priced together at $40. These devices are durable, reliable, and avoid the battery dependencies of wireless peripherals.

## Protection and Portability

The system is housed in a Thermaltake Core V1 case, priced at $60. Compact and lightweight, the case is designed for portability and ease of maintenance, allowing it to be transported or repaired in challenging environments. Dust filters and basic waterproofing protect the hardware from environmental hazards, while a DIY Faraday cage, constructed from inexpensive aluminum mesh, shields the system from electromagnetic pulses (EMPs). This added layer of protection ensures the system’s survival in even the most extreme circumstances.

## Software: GhostBSD as the Foundation

GhostBSD is the backbone of this system, chosen for its simplicity, stability, and security. Its MATE desktop environment strikes the perfect balance between usability and resource efficiency, ensuring smooth performance even with modest hardware. The ZFS file system provides unparalleled data integrity, allowing snapshots and redundancy to safeguard critical information.

The system comes preloaded with essential utilities such as `wget`, `curl`, and `rsync` for managing data and backups. Offline copies of the FreeBSD Handbook and other survival guides ensure that vital knowledge remains accessible even without internet connectivity.

## Cost Breakdown

Every component in this system is selected with purpose, balancing functionality, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. Here’s the total investment:

## Why This System Works

This GhostBSD-powered system is a practical response to the challenges posed by disasters. Its reliance on renewable energy ensures operation even when the grid is down, while its modular and portable design allows for adaptability. Starlink and HAM radio provide robust communication options, critical in times of isolation or infrastructure failure. Every component is selected for durability, efficiency, and ease of repair, ensuring long-term reliability.

This is not a machine built for excess or luxury. It is a companion for crisis management, a tool designed to endure and adapt. Whether facing a hurricane, a blackout, or an evacuation, this system is prepared to keep you connected, informed, and operational when it matters most.
